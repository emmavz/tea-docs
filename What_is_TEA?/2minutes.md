TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications, also known as "Rich dApps." Unlike typical apps, Rich dApps are decentralized. They are serverless and running purely on miner's nodes; just like blockchain. Unlike blockchain dApps and smart contracts, Rich dApps run like centralized cloud-based apps, with similar high scalability and user experiences. TEA Project takes and combines the highlights of both blockchain and cloud computing.

TEA Project has two layers, but unlike most layer-2 solutions that are trying to improve consensus algorithm, TEA is not attempting to improve blockchain; rather, TEA is taking and capitalizing on the benefits of it. In the TEA project, dApps code runs on layer-2, Web Assembly runtime inside hardware protected enclaves. These hardware enclaves generate PoT (Proof of Trust) data handled by the blockchain consensus on layer-1. Therefore, in TEA, blockchain doesn't use consensuses to verify the result of dApps code, rather, the execution environment where the code runs.

So here is the basic assumption: if the execution environment, code and input data are trusted, the execution result can also be trusted. 

TEA Project is based on IPFS, Blockchain, Web Assembly, and Trusted Computing technologies. By adding a TEA hardware security module, the IPFS node can also serve as a computing node besides serving static content. IPFS turns to Inter Planetary Function-as-a-Service. 

TEA project has two tokens. The TEA token is a stable utility token as gas. The Camellia token is an NFT that presents the credit and capability of a TEA mining node. The TEA token economy is an autonomous evolution ecosystem.
